    <h1>A Glossary of Experiences in Alaska</h1>
    <p>Notes from a trip taken July 28, 2018 to August 11, 2018</p>

    <h2>Alaska Airlines</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>All flights within the state operate on Boeing 737 aircraft with six-abreast seating, first class, and three or four flight attendants.
      <li>All flights board from behind a TSA security checkpoint.
      <li>Two free checked bags are allowed on flights within the state of Alaska.
	One large carry-on bag and a personal item are also allowed.
      <li>Be wary of taking a direct flight with stops, as the stops are much less pleasant than the stops on the Ravn Alaska Airlines flights.
	Customers are discouraged from disembarking from the aircraft.
	The stops are usually 45-60 minutes, which can be frustratingly long given that relatively few passengers may board or alight.
	(For my non-airline industry friends, please note that I use airline industry parlance and distinguish a
	"direct" flight from a "nonstop" flight.
	A "direct" flight is any combination of takeoffs and landings that operate on the same calendar day under the same flight number;
	a "nonstop" flight is a single takeoff and landing. 
    </ul>

    <h2>Alaskan Hotel, Juneau</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Avoid staying here for the following reasons.  The extra $20/night to stay somewhere nicer will be worth it:
      <ul>
	<li>It smells like smoke, despite the no smoking policy.
	<li>On open mic nights at the bar downstairs, the music permeates through the whole building and makes sleep quite challenging,
	  even with earplugs.
	<li>The front desk staff is not always knowledgeable about the hotel's policies, such as their AAA discount.
	<li>The doors to the shared restrooms can be partially opened when locked, in one case allowing view from outside the restroom into the shower.
	<li>The doors are quite loud to shut and, in some cases, open.
      </ul>
      <li>Fortunately, I have no complaints about our room itself.
    </ul>

    <h2>Anchorage</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>We stayed at the Arctic Adventure Hostel (<a href="http://arcticadventurehostel.com">webpage</a>)
      <li>The city is surrounded by scenic mountains.
      <li>The road from Anchorage to Seward goes through a national forest.  There are numerous trailheads along this road. 
    </ul>

    <h2>Arctic Adventure Hostel, Anchorage, AK</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>A private room with shared bathroom is a good value.
      <li>The place is clean and well-kept.
      <li>Access to the hostel is limited before 6 or 7 PM.
      <li>Guests must remove shoes shortly after entering the building. 
      <li>Communication with the proprietor proved surprisingly difficult: 
      <ul>
	<li>I never received a confirmation email for my reservation,
	  despite his assurances that I would receive one and despite calling him to ask him to send one.
	<li>He said he would send me an email two days before my arrival with instructions
	  for how to enter my room (we had a late arrival), but he did not.
	  When I called him about this, he said he had sent it already but would send it again.
	  Fortunately, he did send one after this conversation.
	  He was unwilling to provide these instructions over the phone. 
	<li>After checking out early, he called me to say he could not find the key to my room.
	  He later found it (it was in the drop box where guests checking out early are instructed to leave their keys),
	  but did not call me to say he found it.
	  I discovered that he had found it when I called him to follow up on the issue. 
      </ul>
      <li>We were able to arrive late and depart early.
	However, the aforementioned communcation struggles made this a nerve-wracking and frustrating process.
    </ul>
        
    <h2>Barrow</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>See "Utqiagvik"
    </ul>

    <h2>Barter Island</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Apparently, Barter Island is a great polar bear viewing destination.
	We did not see polar bears from the air or during the 10 minutes we were on the ground at the airport.
      <li>There were lots of mosquitoes here.
      <li>It was very windy while we were there.
      <li>The town of Kaktovik is not walking distance from the airport.
      <li>From the air, we could see lots of chunks of sea ice floating in the Arctic Ocean.
      <li>The airport's runway is dirt.
      <li>The airport has no terminal building. 
    </ul>

    <h2>Car Culture</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>One of the things that most impressed me about Alaska is how a car is not required to travel throughout the state.
      <li>There are shuttle buses to Denali from Anchorage and Fairbanks, as well as a train (though we did rent a car to visit Denali).
      <li>The Alaska Railroad serves Seward and Whittier from Anchorage (though we did not visit Whittier and rented a car to visit Seward). 
      <li>The northern locales such as Utqiagvik are small and dense enough that everything is walking distance.
      <li>We spent a week in Juneau without renting a car:
	the only motorized transportation we needed was three Lyft rides, two city bus rides, and two shuttle van rides while there.
      <li>We spent 24 hours in Ketchikan and the only motorized transportation required was shuttle buses to and from the airport. 
    </ul>

    <h2>Deadhorse</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>There are lots of mosquitoes here.
      <li>The airport's runway is paved here.
      <li>Civilization is walking distance from the airport, but it is an industrial town so there isn't really anything to see.
	There are lots of large trucks and vehicles driving around.
      <li>There are not many places to go should you leave the airport terminal.
      <li>You will likely end up with a layover here should you fly from Fairbanks or Anchorage to Barrow. 
      <li>The roads are dirt.  Be prepared for your shoes to become quite muddy.
      <li>The Prudhoe Bay Hotel, walking distance from the airport, serves a very affordable serve-yourself lunch of cold cuts and salad.
      <li>At the airport, the Ravn Alaska terminal is in a completely different building than the Alaska Airlines terminal. 
    </ul>

    <h2>Denali</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>We only traveled to Denali State Park; we did not go to the national park.
	We made this decision because the Internet told us that the mountain views and hiking are both better in the state park.
	We did not regret the decision, though we don't know what we missed in the national park, either. 
      <li>The hiking is good.
	We hiked two out-and-back routes, one from the Ermine Hill Trailhead and one from the Little Coal Creek trailhead.
	We preferred the route from the Ermine Hill Trailhead, which had prettier scenery. 
	The route from the Little Coal Creek trailhead was busier and steeper.
      <li>We camped at the Denali View North Campground.
      <li>The cloudy summer weather frequently obscures views of the mountain from the ground.
	We spent two days in Denali State Park, and the only time we were able to see the peak from the ground was on the drive to the park.
      <li>When flying from Anchorage to Fairbanks, we had a great view of the peak of the mountain.
	It was an overcast day, so such a view would not have been possible from the ground. 
    </ul>

    <h2>Denali View North Campground</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The site was not crowded on a dry Sunday night in July.
	There were three RVs that spend the night and we were the only tent campers.
      <li>The pathway to the tent sites can be hard to find.
	It is behind and to the right of the pay station.
      <li>The tent sites are perfectly fine, but do not seem like they get much use.
	As we were the only tent campers while we were there, we camped in the first suitable site we found.
	Consequently, we did not count how many tent sites there are. 
      <li>There is non-potable water available at the camp.
	Bring your own water or be prepraed to boil or add purification tablets to the water at the campsite.
      <li>Be prepared for some mosquitoes.
      <li>There is a composting toilet at the site.  It is on the opposite side of the parking lot from the tent sites. 
      <li>We were very happy with our experience there.
    </ul>

    <h2>Juneau</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>There is lots of fabulous hiking walking distance from downtown.
      <li>There are many museums downtown.
      <li>There is a wonderful city bus system with frequent service, even on Sundays.
      <li>Avoid the Alaskan Hotel; we were satisfied with the Driftwood Hotel.
      <li>Highly recommend visiting here, as there is lots to do.
      <li>It is very easy to walk around downtown, which is small but cute.
      <li>It is hilly in parts; some "streets" are just staircases.
      <li>Mendenhall Glacier is quite small, though probably still worth seeing. 
    </ul>

    <h2>Kaktovik</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>See "Barter Island"
    </ul>

    <h2>Kayaking</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>We took a three day sea kayaking trip from Juneau while in Alaska.
      <li>Everything gets wet kayaking.  It is a gradual process, but it happens.
      <li>We were satisfied with our rental from Alaska Boat and Kayak Rental (<a href="https://juneaukayak.com">webpage</a>)
      <li>Don't expect kayaking through Auke Bay to be easy: with the wind in the right (wrong?) direction, it can be just as hard as the open-water
	crossings from island to island.
      <li>Kayaking against the wind can be miserable.
	Allow for twice the time and quintuple the frustration if you find yourself in a situation where you have to paddle against the wind. 
      <li>Since everything gets wet, you will be happier if you can find a cabin to stay in overnight.
      <li>Alaska Boat and Kayak Rental lent us gloves that attached to our paddles.  They were helpful.
      <li>Fortunately, with the weather we had we were not cold, even though we were wet.
      <li>Near Juneau, we were able to see many sea lions and even some whales on our kayak trip.
      <li>You will experience significant arm and back soreness after a day of kayaking,
	but not more so than you would with any other comparable lightly physical activity. 
    </ul>

    <h2>Ketchikan</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Ketchikan was the most working-class city we visited in Alaska.
	Fishing dominates the economy.
      <li>The two primary tourist attractions are the Totem Heritage Center and fishing trips.
      <li>My traveling partner went fishing and said it was fun; I walked around town instead and enjoyed myself.
	It is quite hilly if you go inland.
	The Totem Heritage Center took only 30 minutes to fully explore. 
      <li>Beware the crossing guards!
	They're not there to guard your safety while crossing, but rather to guard against the possibility you might actually cross the street.  
      <li>Even more "streets" are staircases than in Juneau, but unlike in Juneau many of these seem to function more as walkways to residents'
	front doors, rather than thru streets.
      <li>Downtown lives and dies with the cruise ships.  It is a ghost town without them and crowded with them.
    </ul>

    <h2>Nuiqsut</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>There were lots of mosquitoes here.
      <li>The town is walking distance from the airport.
      <li>The airport's runway is dirt. 
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Prudhoe Bay</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>See "Deadhorse"
    </ul>

    <h2>Ravn Alaska Airlines</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>We flew Ravn from Anchorage to Barrow via Fairbanks, Barter Island, Deadhorse, and Nuiqsut and
	from Barrow to Anchorage via Nuiqsut, Deadhorse, and Fairbanks.
      <li>It was great fun!  Well worth the added travel time.
      <li>Our tickets were the same price as the same day's Alaska Airlines tickets at the time we purchased.
      <li>Even at Anchorage, Ravn flights do not have TSA checkpoints.
	You can walk to the gate without going through screening.
	You do not need to be a passenger on a flight to go to the gate.
      <li>You must check in an hour in advance of your flight.
	You must check in for each flight separately, even connecting flights, at the airport from which the flight departs.
      <li>Once you check in, you are free to leave the airport until half an hour before your flight's departure time.
	If your flight is delayed, this gives you more time outside of the airport.
	Communicate with the agent checking in passengers to verify the time at which you
	need to return to the airport to be ready to board your flight. 
      <li>The schedule is approximate.
	Flights sometimes leave early, use different aircraft than planned, or skip scheduled stops if no passengers or cargo are getting on or off.
	Communicate with the agent checking you in to verify the time at which you need to be in the airport ready to board the aircraft.
	As long as you check in an hour before your scheduled departure time and
	communicate with the gate agent to verify the time you need to be ready to board the aircraft, you will be fine and not miss your flight.
      <li>The single word that best describes Ravn pilots on the smaller aircraft is "efficient".
	They are all business, all the time, though they will occasionally chat with the ground staff before or after flights. 
	They do not wear the white button-downs and epaulets that larger airlines' pilots wear.
	The one pilot who was moderately conversational (after arrival, of course) was shocked to learn that we were going all the way from
	Barrow to Anchorage.
	Not many people do this.
	He was so surprised by this fact that his modest chatter with the ground staff at Nuiqsut and Deadhorse mostly was about
	the fact that somebody was going all the way to Anchorage.
      <li>Be prepared for smaller, turboprop aircraft.
	From Anchorage, Ravn uses 37-seat Dash 8 Q-100s with a lavatory and flight attendant.
	From smaller stations, they use smaller, 9-seat aircraft without flight attendants.
	The smaller aircraft that were flew on were two 9-seat combi Beech 1900Cs and a Cessna 208 Caravan that had seats so easily removable that
	it operated in a six-seat configuration from Deadhorse to Nuiqsut and a nine-seat configuration from Nuiqsut to Barrow.
	The Beech 1900Cs have two engines and two pilots, but the Cessna had only one engine and one pilot.
	It was noticeably slower than the Beech 1900C and the Dash 8. 
	In neither the Beech 1900C nor the Cessna were passengers able to fully stand up.
	(This is the major difference between the Beech 1900C and the Beech 1900D, which Ravn does not operate but 
	which has a cabin large enough that a normal-height person can stand up.)
      <li>At the northern stations, the mosquitoes are plentiful;
	the passengers who knew what they were doing all immediately donned mosquito head-nets upon arrival.
	The mosquitoes do not seem to bite, but many find them annoying.
	The lone pilot on our Cessna flight spent a solid ten minutes of the cruise portion of our flight doing nothing but swatting mosquitoes.
	He also ate lunch during the cruising portion of the flight. 
      <li>For Dash 8 flights, passengers must show a boarding pass and ID to board.
	For flights on smaller aircraft, the process is more informal: a headcount will usually be taken, and occasionally names will be called.
	No boarding passes or IDs were checked.
      <li>The flight attendant on Dash 8 flights serves beverages and cookies.
	A Ravn Flyer is a nonalcoholic cocktail that is a combination of fruit juice
	(orange and cranberry, I believe, but I can't fully recall) and 7-up.
	There is no service on the smaller aircraft.
	Apparently, beer and wine, which is usually $5, is free on flights delayed an hour.
	However, the flight attendant did not announce this to us on our delayed flight, and I chose not to partake, so I don't know this for certain.
      <li>During check in for flights on smaller aircraft, passengers must tell gate agents their weight (including carry-ons).
      <li>On flights that make stops, such as the flight from Deadhorse to Barrow via Nuiqsut,
	it is customary to disembark from the aircraft for the duration of the stop, unless it is raining.
	There are no airport terminals at these airports. 
      <li>The runways at smaller stations (in our case, Barter Island and Nuiqsut) are unpaved.
      <li>The smaller aircraft are not heated well; be prepared to wear a jacket on board.
      <li>Due to the small size of the aircraft, no large carry-on bags are allowed (but a personal item is).
	Two free checked bags are allowed, though.
	Most customers had two checked bags.  
    </ul>

    <h2>Seward</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>There are many affordable first-come-first-serve campgrounds in town.
	Some offer tent sites.
	The one we stayed at had porta potties, but no other sanitary facilities.
	We were unable to discern a water source at the campsite, but we also brought enough water for our visit so we did not look hard.
	The town has a visitor center with public restrooms. 
    </ul>

    <h2>Talkeetna</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>We did not find a good viewing spot of Denali in Talkeetna.  Perhaps we just did not know where to look.
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Utqiagvik</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Everyone we met called this place "Barrow". 
      <li>The primary tourist attractions are the Arctic Ocean, the grocery store (for its high prices), and the Inupiat Heritage Center.
	Walking around the town is also fun.
	Visiting the northernmost point in the US is not possible without advance planning, as there is no road there.
	Walking to the northernmost point is not recommended because of the danger of encountering a polar bear.
	We did not see any polar bears while we were there.
	Utqiagvik is located well north of the Arctic Circle, so the sun does not set from mid-spring to mid-summer. 
	A highlight of our visit was getting up at 1:45 in the morning to see the sun at its still up, but at its lowest point of the day.
	Since we were there the day before the first sunset of summer, this was just a little tiny sliver of sun hovering above the horizon;
	most of the sun had set.
	The best place to view the sun at its lowest point is the Arctic Ocean coastline. 
      <li>There is lots of car and ATV traffic.  Taxis are plentiful.  There were some pedestrians.  
      <li>The roads are dirt.  Be prepared for your shoes to become quite muddy.
      <li>Apparently, the best restaurant in town is the Japanese-American place called Osaka.
	We had a perfectly good meal there, and thus did not try out the other restaurants.
      <li>There are not so many mosquitoes here.
      <li>We enjoyed our stay at the Airport Inn and recommend it. (<a href="http://www.airportinnak.com">webpage</a>)
      <li>The airport's runway is paved,
      <li>Like in Prudhoe Bay, the Ravn Alaska Airlines terminal at the airport is in a separate building from the Alaska Airlines terminal.
      <li>Utqiagvik is a major Inupiat whaling center.
	(The native Inupiat people practice subsistence whaling.)
	If you can, see if you can find a friendly local to share some maktak with you. 
    </ul>

    <h2>Weather</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Summer is the rainy season.
      <li>High temperatures were in the 60s throughout the state, with the exception of the far north, which was in the 40s.
	Low temperatures were about five to ten degrees colder. 
      <li>Buildings tend to be un-climate controlled in the summer, resulting in some cold,
	unheated buildings in which wearing a jacket was most comfortable.  The 75-degree day we had in Ketchikan resulted in a very warm,
	un-air conditioned airport terminal that afternoon. 
    </ul>
